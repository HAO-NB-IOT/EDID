Warnings:

Block 1, CTA-861 Extension Block:
  IT Video Formats are overscanned by default, but normally this should be underscanned.
  Add a Colorimetry Data Block with the sRGB colorimetry bit set to avoid interop issues.
Block 3, CTA-861 Extension Block:
  IT Video Formats are overscanned by default, but normally this should be underscanned.
  Add a Colorimetry Data Block with the sRGB colorimetry bit set to avoid interop issues.
EDID:
  CTA-861: Native progressive resolution of 1280x800 is smaller than the max preferred progressive resolution 1920x1080.

Failures:

Block 0, Base EDID:
  Detailed Timing Descriptor #1: Mismatch of image size 108x68 mm vs display size 150x100 mm.
  Missing Display Product Name.
  Missing Display Range Limits Descriptor.
Block 1, CTA-861 Extension Block:
  Detailed Timing Descriptor #2: Mismatch of image size 621x341 mm vs display size 150x100 mm.
  Required 640x480p60 timings are missing in the established timings and the SVD list (VIC 1).
  Missing VCDB, needed for Set Selectable RGB Quantization to avoid interop issues.
Block 2, Base EDID:
  Unknown Extension Block.
Block 3, CTA-861 Extension Block:
  Video Data Block: Duplicate VIC 16.
  Detailed Timing Descriptor #3: Mismatch of image size 621x341 mm vs display size 150x100 mm.
  Required 640x480p60 timings are missing in the established timings and the SVD list (VIC 1).
  Missing VCDB, needed for Set Selectable RGB Quantization to avoid interop issues.
EDID:
  Base EDID: The DTD max image size is 621x341mm, which is larger than the display size 150.0x100.0mm.
  Base EDID: EDID specified 1 extension block(s), but found 3 extension block(s).
  Base EDID: EDID 1.3 requires a Block Map Extension in Block 1 if there are more than 2 blocks in the EDID.
